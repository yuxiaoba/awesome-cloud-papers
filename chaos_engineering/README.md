## Fault injection

[19_HotCloud_Co-evolving Tracing and Fault Injection with Box of Pain](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/hotcloud19-paper-bittman.pdf)

This paper presents Box of Pain, a tracer and fault injector for unmodiÔ¨Åed distributed systems that addresses both concerns by interposing at the system call level and dynamically reconstructing the partial order of communication events based on causal relationships.

## Fault Recovery
[21_DSN_FIRestarter: Practical Software Crash Recovery with Targeted Library-level Fault Injection](https://download.vusec.net/papers/firestarter_dsn21.pdf)

FIRestarter injects targeted software faults at the library interface to automatically trigger error handling code for standard library calls already part of the application. In particular, when a crash occurs, we `roll back the application state before the last recoverable library call, inject a fault, and restart execution forcing the call to immediately return a predetermined error code.` This strategy allows the application to automatically bypass the crashing code upon such a restart and exploits existing error-handling code to recover from even persistent bugs.
